# SOLID design principles

- Interface Segregation Principle: Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific. Clients should not be 
forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

Solution: 

We have defined an interface to every action that can be done and assign to every animal the interfaces that apply to it.
